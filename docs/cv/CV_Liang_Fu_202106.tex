\begin{rSection}{Research Papers}
\textbf{``Monetary Policy Surprises and Interest Rates under Chinaâ€˜s Evolving Monetary Policy Framework''} (with Chun-Yu Ho) [Under review]\\
Abstract: This paper assesses the effectiveness of monetary policy in China by examining the influence of monetary policy on market interest rates using an event-study approach. The monetary policy framework in China has evolved considerably in the past two decades, increasingly moving from using administrative and quantity instruments to price-based instruments. Overall, we find that price-based instruments are nearly as effective as quantity and administrative instruments in impacting market interest rates, especially since the completion of interest rate liberalization. Furthermore, central bank communications containing information on future monetary policy affect medium- and long-term market interest rates.

\textbf{``Political Stability and Credibility of Currency Boards''} (with Shu Feng, Chun-Yu Ho and Wai-Yip Alex Ho) [Under review] \\
Abstract: This paper examines the credibility of currency boards of Argentina, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hong Kong, Latvia and Lithuania. We employ a Markov switching model to estimate the credibility of a currency board as the expected rate of depreciation induced by self-fulfilling behavior. The currency board of our sample countries are all subject to self-fulfilling behavior, which suggests that the credibility of a currency board determines the expected rate of depreciation. We also find evidence that the credibility of currency boards positively relates to the political stability of adopting economies.

`\textbf{`Real Exchange Rate and Innovation: Firm-Level Evidence from China''} (with Chun-Yu Ho and Xiaoli Zhang) \\
Abstract: This paper examines how exchange rate movement affects firms' innovation activities using a panel dataset of Chinese manufacturing firms. We construct firm-specific effective real exchange rate (RER) to measure the exchange rate shocks faced by each firm according to its composition of trading partners. We find that a 10\% increase in effective RER (i.e. depreciation) increase the share of new product sales in total sales by about 0.2 percentage points. Our results are robust to 1) the inclusion of firm- and industry-specific control variables, firm fixed effects and year effects; and 2) the use of alternative weighting in constructing effective RER and alternative estimation methods. We further show that a better export opportunity is the main channel through which a depreciation of exchange rate promotes innovation activities. A better export opportunity leads to a higher revenue from exports, which in turn, we argue that, relaxes the financial constraints faced by firms to conduct innovation activities.

\textbf{``Differential Regional Impact of U.S. Monetary Policy: Evidence from a Near VAR''} \\
Abstract: This paper finds that U.S. monetary policy had different effects across states during the 1979-2007 period by estimating a near vector autoregressive (VAR) model, in which each state's economy is affected by the national monetary policy as well as regional variables, while the common monetary policy responds only to aggregate macroeconomic variables. States in which (durable) manufacturing accounts for a larger share of gross state product tend to be more sensitive to monetary policy shocks. States containing a larger concentration of small firms are more responsive to monetary policy shocks, providing support for a broad credit channel of monetary policy transmission.

\textbf{``The Impact of China's Monetary Policy on Exchange Rates: Evidence from High-frequency Data''}\\
Abstract: This paper examines the behavior of the Chinese renminbi/U.S. dollar exchange rate in reaction to China's monetary policy actions and statements, using an event study approach coupled with intra-day high-frequency data.
